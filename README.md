### Capstone Project

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Diabetes is a common disease that is easily  encountered among our family members or friends. Even though it has been studied thoroughly, 
it is a topic I would like to research to understand what factors could influence a person's health and result in diabetes.

#### Research Question
Which personal traits can be used to predict diabetes?

#### Data Sources
The dataset I used was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset

#### Methodology
I will be testing different classification models such as Logistic Regression and KNearestNeighbors to determine which model can correctly predict diabetes. These models will be trained using a dataset containing information on diabetes.

#### Results
Of the models tested and using precision score as an indicator, the Decision Tree Classifier model had the highest precision score. In addition, the Decision Tree Classifier model  had the highest recall score and
the lowest fit time. The model had the second highest accuracy among the models tested.

#### Next steps
The results that have been produced were based off of one dataset. It would be beneficial to have more diabetes datasets to further test the classification models and different parameters 
to see if there are any differences in the results produced.
